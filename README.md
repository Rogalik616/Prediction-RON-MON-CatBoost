# Prediction of RON and MON octane numbers for individual substances

**RON** (Research Octane Number) and **MON** (Motor Octane Number) are two important parameters used to characterise the quality and octane number of petrol. They are of great importance in the petroleum and automotive industries. The determination of RON and MON is important for the following reasons:

* Engine efficiency and power

* Detonation prevention

* Environmental protection

* Compatibility and miscibility

* Economic aspects

These characteristics are often measured experimentally and there are standards by which octane numbers are determined. However, for various reasons (economic efficiency or evaluation of new compounds), the prediction of octane numbers is an urgent task.
